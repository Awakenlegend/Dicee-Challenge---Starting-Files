Dicee Challenge 🎲

Overview

The Dicee Challenge is a simple web-based dice game that generates random dice rolls for two players. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is a great beginner-friendly project to understand the basics of DOM manipulation and event handling.

Features

🎲 Two dice are rolled randomly upon refreshing the page.

🏆 The player with the higher dice value wins.

⚖️ If both dice show the same number, it's a draw.

🎨 Simple and clean UI design.

Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the webpage.

CSS – Styling the webpage.

JavaScript – Logic to generate random dice rolls and update the UI dynamically.

How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Awakenlegend/Dicee-Challenge---Starting-Files.git

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Refresh the page to roll the dice and determine the winner.

Project Structure

📂 Dicee-Challenge
│── 📄 index.html      # Main HTML file
│── 📄 style.css       # Stylesheet for UI design
│── 📄 script.js       # JavaScript file for game logic
│── 📂 images          # Dice images

How It Works

The JavaScript file uses Math.random() to generate a random number between 1 and 6 for each dice.

The dice images are updated dynamically based on the random number.

The result is displayed based on the dice values.

Future Improvements

🎵 Add sound effects when rolling the dice.

🔄 Add a "Roll Again" button instead of refreshing the page.

🎨 Improve the UI with animations and enhanced styling.
